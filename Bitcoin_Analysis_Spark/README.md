# Analyzing a Large Graph with Spark

## Objective
Throughout this project, i explored different methods of graph analysis with pyspark.
Currently, I have focused on different ways of data wrangling with pyspark. Especially, the graph being a weighted directed graph, I have explored fundamental graph analytics such as finding the sums of weighted-ins and outs for each node. Later, I will explore some more advaned graph analytics algorithms and techniques with the dataset.

## Dataset
This gradph dataset was derived from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection.
Below is their website's description of the dataset

This is who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using Bitcoin on a platform called Bitcoin OTC. Since Bitcoin users are anonymous, there is a need to maintain a record of users' reputation to prevent transactions with fraudulent and risky users. Members of Bitcoin OTC rate other members in a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. This is the first explicit weighted signed directed network available for research.

## How to
This project runs on Databricks' free-tier DataFrame API.
The dbc file located in the directory contains the source code of thie notebook.

Details on how to set up the API can be found at : https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR9XytsxrXNpUVm1VBX3v1JwerfAMK97v_9Wy6GFNCucxd5Izgu7lmj9CFLIDDWBjN7NgRVm4pZJNj9/pub
This directory contains two files 1) Notebook 2) Source file.
